      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I was born on 22 May 2003. I started schoool at three years old but I skipped pre-school and went straight to pre-unit. I did my primary studies at Sukari Presbyterian. There, I finished with a 380 in total. I then went to High School at NorthGate schools. I managed to get a C plain even after the whole pandemic, I didn't expect it but at least it was average. Personally, I loved my education experience in both primary and highschool. </p>

        <div class="Moringa">
          <p> In all my life, I have loved technology, anything to do with computers, web, or just digging through on how people navigate through the web and come up with apps and websites. Honestly I have dreamed of being a technology guru since I was young, the desire to be among those people who develop softwares. I actually wanted to be a hacker when I was younger, that was until I heard it was illegal. Anyway, when I finished school, I was not sure if I wanted to go to the whole world of technology, mainly because I didn't believe in myself but my mom pushed me to go study IT because she knew I could do it. That is when i was recommended to go to Moringa School by one of the staff members. I was a bit peculiar about it because I had never heard the name before but I accepted because I dislike the feeling of having too much free time on my hands because it's easy to mess yourself. So I came to Moringa with a positive mind and a desire that I will become a software developer and so far I am really enjoying my time here and everyone there is very nice. At times I feel small and challenged because I am interacting with some people who have been exposed to the world of IT whereas I'm starting but I've never held it to heart and I always have an open mind towards everyone because they will help me see from different point of views and it expands your mind. So long story short, I am having a lot of fun here and I am eager to learn more  
          you can have a look at some of my projects at github although they are not finished yet.

          <p>Moringa has helped me develop a few websites of my own like:

              <li><a href="file:///home/jessica/Desktop/my-first-website/favorite-things.html">favorite things</a>This was a webpage talking about my favorite things and my interests.</li>
              <li> <a href="file:///home/jessica/Desktop/my-first-website/index.html">my-first-website</a>This was the first webpage we created</li>
              <li><a href="file:///home/jessica/Desktop/my-first-website/my-pet.html">my-pet</a>This is a website about my pet and its favorite things</li>
              <li> And many more.</li>
